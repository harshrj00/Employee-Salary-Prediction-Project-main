# Employee Salary Prediction App

A Streamlit-powered web app that predicts whether an individual's annual salary is likely to exceed â‚¹50,000 based on demographic and financial attributes. Built during internship at Edunet Foundation under IBM SkillBuild mentorship.

## Features
- Clean and branded UI with Edunet & IBM logos
- Animated result feedback (balloons , snow )
- Human-readable dropdowns for categorical features
- Full input summary with prediction result
- Integrated ML model trained on the Adult dataset
- Deployable via platforms like Render

---
## Dataset Overview
The model was trained using the Adult Income dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains over 32,000 records with 15 features including:
- Age, workclass, education level, marital status
- Occupation, relationship, race, gender
- Capital gain/loss, hours worked per week, country
- Income class (â‰¤â‚¹50,000 or >â‚¹50,000)
> All categorical data was encoded using LabelEncoder for compatibility with scikit-learn models.

---
##  Data Preprocessing
- Removed rows with missing values (? symbols) across workclass, occupation, and native country
- Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder for compatibility with scikit-learn
- Scaled numerical features for balanced model convergence
- Splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) to ensure reliable evaluation
-----------
## Model Comparison & Selection
Before finalizing the Gradient Boosting model, several algorithms were evaluated for accuracy, precision, and reliability. Here's a summary:
| Model                    | Accuracy | Notes                                    |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression      | ~79%     | Fast and interpretable, but underfit     |
| Decision Tree            | ~82%     | Good baseline, prone to overfitting      |
| Random Forest            | ~84%     | Stable performance, slower than GBM      |
| Gradient Boosting (final)| ~85%     | Best trade-off between accuracy & speed  |
- Gradient Boosting Classifier was selected for its superior performance on both training and validation sets.
- All models were trained and tested on the preprocessed Adult dataset using an 80/20 split.
- Accuracy and other metrics were computed using classification_report and cross-validation.
> This comparison demonstrates thoughtful experimentation before deployment â€” aligning with best practices in machine learning workflow.

## Model Building â€” Gradient Boosting Classifier
| Parameter       | Value    |
|----------------|----------|
| Model           | GradientBoostingClassifier |
| `n_estimators`  | 100      |
| `learning_rate` | 0.1      |
| `max_depth`     | 3        |
| `random_state`  | 42       |
| Encoding        | LabelEncoder on categorical features |
| Deployment      | Pickle model (`best_model.pkl`) loaded into `app.py` |

- Gradient Boosting was chosen for its robust performance and ability to reduce bias & variance
- Trained using the cleaned and encoded dataset on all features
- Final model serialized with pickle as best_model.pkl
------------------
## Feature Importance
Top contributing features identified by the model:
1. Age  
2. Education Level  
3. Hours per Week  
4. Capital Gain  
5. Occupation  
> These attributes most significantly influence income prediction
----------------
## Evaluation Summar
| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | ~85%   |
| Precision  | 0.86   |
| Recall     | 0.83   |
| F1-Score   | 0.84   |
## Why Gradient Boosting?
- Combines multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model
- Handles categorical and numeric features efficiently
- Performs better than simple decision trees in generalization and precision
> The final model was exported using pickle and loaded in the deployed app through app.py.
